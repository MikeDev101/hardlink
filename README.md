# HardLink
HardLink is a custom device I/O extension for Scratch 3.0. It is built upon Cloudlink technology.

## NOTE: THIS PROJECT IS TEMPORARILY ON HOLD, IT WILL RESUME WHEN CLOUDLINK S2.3 IS RELEASED.

HardLink can access Parallel, Serial, Local Disk, Power, WiFi, Bluetooth, GPIO, Gamepads, and more. Simply run the extension and have the HardLink service running in the background to use HardLink.

You can configure what I/O devices the extension has permission to access in the manager program.
